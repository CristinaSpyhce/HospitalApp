# HospitalApp
This application shows the names and details of the patients for the doctors.
It displays the name of the doctor and their specialization, afterwards it goes to a login page where the doctor can log in . If the login is successful, the doctor can see only his patients. If they click on the name of the patient, they can see the patient's details.
It works very good, but the only issue is that I didn;t succeed in establishing the routing from the login page to the page with patients names. I didn;t succeed to redirect.
